# XeroDiscrimination - TechLauncher Project 2019 S2
---

## Overview

### Background and Scope
Due to systematic and direct discrimination, young people in LGBTIQ communities face difficulties and challenges in finding jobs. On the other hand, employers who are friendly to the community have a hard time standing out. We all want to have a great experience when looking for our dream job or hiring the right person. This is the problem we want to solve by using technology.
